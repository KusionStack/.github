We are a team of platform engineers who firmly believe the [Platform Engineering](https://platformengineering.org/) accelerates innovation. Dynamic Configuration Management, Infrastructure Orchestration, and Release Management are the core components of the platform, and we are building open-source toolkits to help organizations unlock the power of Platform Engineering.

## 💻 Kusion

[Kusion](https://github.com/KusionStack/kusion) is a modern application delivery and management toolchain that enables developers to specify desired intent in a declarative way and then use consistent workflow to drive continuous deployment through the application lifecycle. 

Inspired by the phrase **Fusion on Kubernetes**, Kusion aims to help application and platform developers develop and deliver in a self-serviceable, fast, reliable, and collaborative way.

## ⚙️ Operating

[KusionStack Operating](https://github.com/KusionStack/operating) consists of workloads and operators built on Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions, with a primary aim of bridging the gap between the platform and Kubernetes.

By keeping more operation works finished in the Kubernetes layer, KusionStack Operating reduces complexity when interacting with Kubernetes and enhances convenience for platform developers.

## 🚀 Karpor

[Karpor](https://github.com/KusionStack/karpor) is a Modern **Kubernetes Explorer** focusing on **🔍 Search, 💡 Insight and 🤖 Intelligence**. 

It has keywords such as self-host, non-invasive, read-only, secure compliance, multi-cloud/multi-cluster support, custom logical view, and can serve as a **Kubernetes Data Plane** to reduce the cost of discovering and understanding kubernetes resources.
