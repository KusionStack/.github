We are a team of platform engineers who firmly believe the [Platform Engineering](https://platformengineering.org/) accelerates innovation. Dynamic Configuration Management, Infrastructure Orchestration, and Release Management are the core components of the platform, and we are building open-source toolkits to help organizations unlock the power of Platform Engineering.

## 🔗 Kusion

[Kusion](https://github.com/KusionStack/kusion) is an intent-driven [Platform Orchestrator](https://internaldeveloperplatform.org/platform-orchestrators/), which sits at the core of an [Internal Developer Platform](https://internaldeveloperplatform.org/what-is-an-internal-developer-platform/). With Kusion you can enhance self-service developer experience, by giving developers the ability to deploy applications with all dependencies to all environments, with a single application specification - [AppConfiguration](https://www.kusionstack.io/docs/next/concepts/app-configuration).

Inspired by the phrase **Fusion on Kubernetes**, Kusion aims to simplify the process of deploying applications into your infrastructure and helps platform teams standardize the whole deployment process.


## 🚀 Karpor

[Karpor](https://github.com/KusionStack/karpor) is Intelligence for Kubernetes. It brings advanced **🔍 Search**, **💡 Insight** and **✨ AI** to Kubernetes. With Karpor, you can gain crucial visibility into your Kubernetes clusters across any clouds and empower developers to ship faster.

As world's most promising Kubernetes Explorer/Kubernetes Dashboard, our end goal is to build a **small and beautiful, vendor-neutral, developer-friendly, community-driven** project! 


## ⚙️ Kooperator

[KusionStack Operating](https://github.com/KusionStack/operating) consists of workloads and operators built on Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions, with a primary aim of bridging the gap between the platform and Kubernetes.

By keeping more operation works finished in the Kubernetes layer, KusionStack Operating reduces complexity when interacting with Kubernetes and enhances convenience for platform developers.
